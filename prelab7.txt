System that needs to be solved is the equation a = inv(V)@y
This will yield the a coefficients that make up the interpolation polynomial

Code to find the Vandermonde matrix can be taken from Homework 4

import numpy as np

f = lambda x: FUNCTION

x = np.arange(RANGE)
F = np.zeros(N)

for i in range(N):
    F[i] = f(x[i])


rows = N
cols = N
 
V = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        V[i][j] = x[i]**j

For the remainder of the lab, the goal is to explore different interpolation methods (Legrange, Newton-Divided
, etc) and see how they fit with different N values. Then we will explore Chebechev points and how they reduce
error created from the Runge phenomena
